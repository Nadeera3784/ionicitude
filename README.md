# Ionicitude Documentation

This repository branch contains the source code for [the library website](http://tazaf.github.io/ionicitude/).
You'll find it's documentation there, so please, use it instead of browsing this branch's files :wink:

## Bugs and issues

Feel free to report any bugs and issues you would encounter while reading the library's documentation website.
Please use the GitHub Issues tool for that, as precised in [the contributing file](https://github.com/Tazaf/ionicitude/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md). 

_The library website uses Jekyll and GitHub Pages._
